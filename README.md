# Python Projects: Basic Calculator, Tic-Tac-Toe Game, and To-Do List Application

This repository contains three simple Python projects that demonstrate basic programming concepts and functionality. Each project is designed to be easy to understand and can be run directly in a Python environment.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Basic Calculator
The **Basic Calculator** is a simple command-line tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program runs in a loop, prompting the user to enter an operation and two numbers. It handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors gracefully.

**Features:**
- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Input validation for operations and numbers.
- Option to quit the calculator by entering `'q'`.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the `Basic Calculator.py` script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

### 2. Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The game ends in a tie if all nine squares are filled without a winner.

**Features:**
- Displays the game board after each move.
- Checks for a winner after each move.
- Handles invalid moves and prompts the player to try again.
- Alternates turns between players `X` and `O`.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the `Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game.py` script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

### 3. To-Do List Application
The **To-Do List Application** is a simple command-line tool that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add, view, and delete tasks from the list. The application runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit.

**Features:**
- Add new tasks to the list.
- View all tasks in the list.
- Delete tasks by their task number.
- Input validation for task numbers.
- Option to quit the application.

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the `To-Do List Application.py` script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage your to-do list.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
